# Hotel-Bookings-Analysis

![](hotelbookings.jpg)

## Introduction

This is a PowerBI project on hotel bookings analysis of an imaginary hotel called **CodeitSoft Hotel**. The project is to analyze and derive insights into the hotel's bookings data from the last 9 years. 

**_Disclaimer_** : _All datasets and reports do not reresent any company, institution or country, but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate capabilities of Power BI._ 

## Problem Statement
The analysis was done to determine

1. What is the total number of registered electric vehicles?
2. Which County and City have the highest number of registered electric vehicles?
3. What is the average electric range of the registered electric vehicles?
4. What is the average electric range of BEVs and PHEVs?
5. What is the percentage of Battery Electric Vehicles and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles?
6. Which model has the maximum electric range?
7. What is the most populated model?
8. Who is the leading electric vehicle maker?
9. Which year is the most prevalent electric vehicle model year?

## Skills/Concepts Demonstrated 

The following Power Bi features were incorporated:
- DAX
- Measures
- Tooltips
- Filters

## Modelling

No data was modeled since only the table was needed for the analysis.

## Visualization

The report comprises 2 pages:
1. Main Page with the KPIs
2. A continuation page.
